# Segformer for Mars Landslide Segmentation Challenge

This repository is built based on [M3LSNet](https://github.com/tingul4/M3LSNet), and contains the solution for the **1st Mars Landslide Segmentation (Mars-LS) Challenge**. It implements Dual_Segformer with ConvNext backbonefor the challenges of Martian terrain segmentation.
